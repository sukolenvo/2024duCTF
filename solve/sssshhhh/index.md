## Prologue

Difficulty: beginner

Category: reverse engineering

Solved: 81

!!! quote "Description"
    Great news! We found the Kookaburras!... Bad news.. They're locked up. We've managed to get access to the central terminal and ripped a binary off of it for you to analyse. Maybe you can find a way to free our friends?

Input files:

??? info "encoding.txt"
    

NB:


* Following indices bases system is used to avoid ambiguity. Whenever element of a collection is referenced by **number**, 0-based index implied. 
 
  Ie, element `0` of list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16]` is `1`, Element `3` is `8`.
  
  When element is reference in explanation with **word** (first, third...), 1-based system is implied.

  Ie, first character of string `Hello World!` is `H`, fifth is `o`.

* Solution code was redacted for readability purposes. Due to time pressure during the competition I was using a lot of one-letter variables and questionable code structure.
