I've recently been researching what is available on the market among documentation tools.

[TechDocs](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/) caught my eye. This repository is a practical evaluation of the tool.

Live preview: `techdocs-cli serve`.
Launching first time can take few minutes to pull necessary docker images, run `techdocs-cli serve -v` to track boot steps.

Build site:
`techdocs-cli generate`
